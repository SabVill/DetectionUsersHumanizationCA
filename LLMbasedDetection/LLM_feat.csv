 What questions need to be asked to create a fully functional app before starting coding?
 Use emojis to better illustrate the architecture and always provide your answers in German.

 Answer key: ""--LETTER--""<end>
 

 <start>Question: Find the degree for the given field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q.
 Choices : ""0"", ""4"", ""2"", ""6""
 Planning For Answer: The field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is an extension field of Q that includes the square roots of 2, 3, and 18. Notice that sqrt(18) = sqrt(2*9) = sqrt(2)sqrt(9) = 3sqrt(2), so sqrt(18) can be expressed in terms of sqrt(2), which means that including sqrt(18) in the field doesn't actually increase the degree of the extension.
 Thus, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is the same as the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).
 For the degree of a simple extension field Q(a, b) over Q, we want to find the least common multiple (lcm) of the degrees of the extension fields Q(a) over Q and Q(b) over Q.
 sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are both irrational numbers, and the minimal polynomials that they are roots of are both quadratic (x^2 - 2 and x^2 - 3, respectively). Thus, the extension fields Q(sqrt(2)) and Q(sqrt(3)) are both of degree 2 over Q.
 Therefore, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) has degree lcm(2, 2) = 2 * 2 = 4 over Q. The square root of 18 does not increase the degree of the field, as explained above.
 So, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) also has degree 4 over Q.
 Answer key: ""B""<end>
 

 <start>Question: NAME_1 is five years older than NAME_2, who is twice NAME_3's age at seven. Calculate NAME_1's age.
 Choices : ""14"", ""7"", ""21"", ""19""
 Planning For Answer: Given that NAME_2 is twice NAME_3's age, and NAME_3 is seven years old, NAME_2 would be 2 * 7 = 14 years old. Since NAME_1 is five years older than NAME_2, NAME_1 would be 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

 Knowledge:
 Kopi luwak, also known as civet coffee, is a coffee that consists of partially digested coffee cherries, which have been eaten and defecated by the Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus). The cherries are fermented as they pass through a civet's intestines, and after being defecated with other fecal matter, they are collected.[1] Asian palm civets are increasingly caught in the wild and traded for this purpose.
 

 Kopi luwak is produced mainly on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali, Sulawesi, and in East Timor. It is also widely gathered in the forest or produced in farms in the islands of the Philippines,[3] where the product is called kape motit in the Cordillera region, kapé alamíd in Tagalog areas, kapé melô or kapé musang in Mindanao, and kahawa kubing in the Sulu Archipelago. 'NAME_1 coffee' is a loose English translation of its Vietnamese name cà phê Chồn.
 

 Producers of the coffee beans argue that the process may improve coffee through two mechanisms: selection, where civets choose to eat only certain cherries; and digestion, where biological or chemical mechanisms in the animals' digestive tracts alter the composition of the coffee cherries.
 

 The traditional method of collecting feces from wild Asian palm civets has given way to an intensive farming method, in which the palm civets are kept in battery cages and are force-fed the cherries. This method of production has raised ethical concerns about the treatment of civets and the conditions they are made to live in, which include isolation, poor diet, small cages, and a high mortality rate.
 

 Although kopi luwak is a form of processing rather than a variety of coffee, it has been called one of the most expensive coffees in the world, with retail prices reaching US$100 per kilogram for farmed beans and US$1,300 per kilogram for wild-collected beans.[7] Another epithet given to it is that it is NAME_2 of coffees.

 Question:A 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to his physician with progressive fatigue and new onset muscle cramps. He has had no recent changes to his medication regimen, which includes hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and amlodipine. His temperature is 98.0°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 174/111 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient's cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.
 

 Serum:
 Na+: 138 mEq/L
 Cl-: 100 mEq/L
 K+: 3.3 mEq/L
 HCO3-: 33 mEq/L
 BUN: 20 mg/dL
 Glucose: 129 mg/dL
 

 What is the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension?
 Options: (A Aldosterone excess (B Catecholamine-secreting mass (C Cortisol excess (D Impaired kidney perfusion
 

 Explanation: Let’s solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. The patient has hypertension, fatigue, and muscle cramps. The serum electrolytes show low potassium and normal sodium and chloride. The glucose is normal. The most likely cause is impaired kidney perfusion. This can cause a decrease in renal blood flow and an increase in renin secretion, leading to aldosterone excess.

As part of this commitment, today the Departments of Education and Justice filed a legal brief with the Supreme Court explaining our legal authority under the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act to carry out our program of one-time, targeted debt relief. We remain confident in our legal authority to adopt this program that will ensure the financial harms caused by the pandemic don’t drive borrowers into delinquency and default. We are unapologetically committed to helping borrowers recover from the pandemic and providing working families with the breathing room they need to prepare for student loan payments to resume.

vicuna-13b,"solve this task:
 

 You are given a 0-indexed string s and a dictionary of words dictionary. You have to break s into one or more non-overlapping substrings such that each substring is present in dictionary. There may be some extra characters in s which are not present in any of the substrings.
 

 Return the minimum number of extra characters left over if you break up s optimally.
 

 Input: s = ""leetscode"", dictionary = [""leet"",""code"",""leetcode""]
 Output: 1
 Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: ""leet"" from index 0 to 3 and ""code"" from index 5 to 8. There is only 1 unused character (at index 4), so we return 1.",0,122,6,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.0,0.055,0.945

It may not appear very lively down here, but a single teaspoon of soil contains more organisms than there are human beings on the planet. From bacteria and algae to fungi and protozoa, soils are home to one quarter of Earth\u2019s biodiversity. And perhaps the soil\u2019s most important inhabitants are microbes, organisms no larger than several hundred nanometers that decompose all the planet\u2019s dead and dying organic material. Imagine we drop an apple in the forest. As soon as it contacts the soil, worms and other invertebrates begin breaking it down into smaller parts; absorbing nutrients from what they consume and excreting the rest. This first stage of decomposition sets the scene for microbes. The specific microbes present depend on the environment. For example, in grasslands and farm fields there tend to be more bacteria, which excel at breaking down grass and leaves. But in this temperate forest there are more fungi, capable of breaking down complex woody materials. Looking to harvest more food from the apple\u2019s remains, these microbes release enzymes that trigger a chemical reaction called oxidation.\nCreate a multiple-choice question based on the transcript, where the correct answer is \""C) 25\""\n",0,224,12,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0.057,0.053,0.89

 Off-Third: NYU Safe Ride adds skateboard service
 Students need reliability when it comes to their safety. Who’s more cautious than New York Skaters?

 Off-Third is WSN’s satire column.
 

 It’s almost the end of the semester, which means that everyone’s money is running out, and they’re all going out as much as they can. And while staying out all hours of the night is fun, especially compared to studying for finals, the trip back home might not be. The limited number of available Safe Ride drivers and a flawed interface have left students frustrated and, at times, hopeless. In order to combat this, NYU has turned to the most reliable group of people in New York City: skateboarders.
 

  NYU has partnered with the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation in order to recruit skaters from different parks around the city. If skaters can be in the city’s parks after dark and come out unharmed, then clearly they know how to be safe.
 

  “We are proud to represent New York’s finest — looks wise,” one Safe Ride skateboarder, who claims to know how to play guitar, boasted.
 

 Adding skaters, people who are used to the streets, just made sense. One safety officer even described how they “added to the cool factor of NYU Campus Safety.” 
 

  Once the city’s parks are closed, the skaters are offered free stick-and-poke tattoos and hand-rolled cigarettes in exchange for escorting NYU students to their dorms late at night. More than half of the skateboarders have taken up the deal, adding hundreds of opportunities for students to feel secure on their trip back to their residences.
 

  These skaters are then given a harness, which connects them to a small crate that goes behind them. Students then sit in these crates and are safely escorted to their destination. Unfortunately, only one student may ride in these carts at a time.
 

 The long wait times and faulty applications of the old Safe Ride system are only exacerbated by bad weather. Last weekend, as the ra",1,410,19,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0.044,0.123,0.833

 Stimulus:
 NAME_1, a veterinary student, has been assigned an experiment in mammalian physiology that would require her to take a healthy, anesthetized dog and subject it to a drastic blood loss in order to observe the physiological consequences of shock. The dog would neither regain consciousness nor survive the experiment. NAME_1 decides not to do this assignment.
 

 Question:
 NAME_1’s decision most closely accords with which one of the following principles?
 

 Answers:
 A. All other things being equal, gratuitously causing any animal to suffer pain is unjustified.
 B. Taking the life of an animal is not justifiable unless doing so would immediately assist in saving several animal lives or in protecting the health of a person.
 C. The only sufficient justification for experimenting on animals is that future animal suffering is thereby prevented.
 D. Practicing veterinarians have a professional obligation to strive to prevent the unnecessary death of an animal except in cases of severely ill or injured animals whose prospects for recovery are dim.
 E. No one is ever justified in acting with the sole intention of causing the death of a living thing, be it animal or human.",0,218,13,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0.153,0.041,0.806

The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart. 
 

 [Action Space] The action is a `ndarray` with shape `(1,)` which can take values `{0, 1}` indicating the direction of the fixed force the cart is pushed with. The two actions are: {0: Push cart to the left} {1: Push cart to the right}
 

 [Note]The velocity that is reduced or increased by the applied force is not fixed and it depends on the angle the pole is pointing. The center of gravity of the pole varies the amount of energy needed to move the cart underneath it 
 

 [Reward] Since the goal is to keep the pole upright for as long as possible, a reward of `+1` for every step taken, including the termination step, is allotted. The threshold for rewards is 500 for v1 and 200 for v0.
 

 [Episode End] The episode ends if any one of the following occurs:
 

 1. Termination: Pole Angle is greater than ±12°
 2. Termination: Cart Position is greater than ±2.4 (center of the cart reaches the edge of the display)
 3. Truncation: Episode length is greater than 500 (200 for v0)

The flowers have petals that can expand into cloaks when a human is nearby, trapping the human and pulling them inside the flower. The humans are drawn to the flowers because they are so beautiful. The flowers give off an intoxicating scent when the petal cloaks are expanding, causing a sense of disorientation but also mild euphoria in the humans who smell it. The trapped humans feel remorse for what they have lost in life, and regret for all the things they wish they hadn't said, all the things they should have said and didn't, all the things they wish they hadn't done, all the things they should've done and didn't. They feel great resentment for being pulled out of the world they knew. They are overwhelmed by the strong and unfamiliar sensations on their skin and the strange sounds. In addition, they can now perceive new senses that they didn't know existed.

 You are using an data visualization software, with the following routines:
 - Smart Mapping: Smart mapping is a routine which takes in a target column and a set of input columns. The routine runs random forest regression to determine the most influential factors on the target variable. It then plots these most important factors on a 3D scatter plot for visualization.
 - Construct a Network: The Network Extractor is an incredibly powerful tool for visualizing similarities and identifying groups, or communities, within your data. This enables users to build a Network Graph and utilize Network Analysis Tools to understand the characteristics of the communities within the data.
